 To create an indoor navigation app with ARFoundation WITHOUT the usage of Cloud Anchors or using ARPointCloud Data. Using additional functionality with Unitys NavMesh + multiple navigation targets.(recommended version: Unity  2022.3.0f1).Necessary packages (AR Foundation, ARCore XR Plugin, NavMesh, and Input System) are installed via Unity Package Manager.
How this application works:
1. This application shows navigations in the map which we used while developing it.
2. When we scan the qr code , it interpretes our current location
3. Then we should select the destination
4. It will show path accordingly.
